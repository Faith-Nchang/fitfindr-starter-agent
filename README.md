> python app.py fields                    # what you can filter on
> python app.py ask 'vintage graphic tee under $30'

     HOW TO USE THIS FILE

     This is your submission. Fill each section in as you finish the milestone
     it belongs to — don't leave it all to the end.

     Unit 3 asks for the first five sections. Unit 4 adds the five below them.
     Leave the unit 4 sections alone until then; they're here so you know
     what's coming.

     Everything is pasted as TEXT. No screenshots, no images, no video links.
     A typed block of output gets full credit; a picture of the same output
     gets none.

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 3 — THE BUILD ═══════════════════════ -->

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences: what a user asks for, and what they get back. -->



---

## Tool Inventory

<!-- Four lines per tool. This is worth 2 points and it's the single most
     common place students lose them.

     "Returns a list" earns NOTHING. The description has to say what is IN
     the list.

     The empty case isn't optional either — it's the thing your loop branches
     on, and if you don't decide it here you'll discover it as a crash in
     Milestone 5. -->

### `search_listings`

- **What it does:** Searches `data/listings.json` for items matching a keyword description, optionally narrowed by size and a price ceiling. It does not call the model.
- **Inputs:** `description` (str, keywords such as "vintage graphic tee"); `size` (str or None, None skips size filtering); `max_price` (float or None, inclusive, None skips price filtering).
- **Returns:** A list of at most `config.SEARCH_RESULT_LIMIT` (10) listing dicts, best match first. Each dict has `id` (str), `title` (str), `description` (str), `category` (str), `style_tags` (list of str), `size` (str), `condition` (str), `price` (float), `colors` (list of str), `brand` (str or None) and `platform` (str). Results are ranked by how many description keywords appear in the title, tags, category and description, and anything with zero keyword matches is dropped.
  - *Keyword rule:* the description is lowercased and split into words on anything that isn't a letter or digit. Filler words like "a", "the", "in", "under", "size" and "for" are ignored, so they never count as matches. Each remaining word scores one point per listing if it appears as a whole word in that listing's title, category, style tags or description (a plural counts as a match for the singular and the other way round, so "jeans" finds "jean"). Listings tied on score keep the order they have in the data file.
  - *Size match rule:* the size is compared case-insensitively against whole tokens of the listing's size, split on `/`, spaces and parentheses, so `M` matches `M`, `S/M` and `M/L` but not `XL`, `US 9` or `W30`. A listing whose size is `One Size` also matches any size.
- **When it has nothing:** An empty list `[]`. Not `None`, and no exception.

### `suggest_outfit`

- **What it does:** Asks the model for one or two outfits built around the found item, naming pieces the user already owns when the wardrobe has any.
- **Inputs:** `new_item` (dict, a listing dict as returned by `search_listings`); `wardrobe` (dict with an `items` key holding a list of wardrobe item dicts, each with `id`, `name`, `category`, `colors`, `style_tags` and `notes`).
- **Returns:** A non-empty string of outfit suggestions. With a populated wardrobe it names specific wardrobe pieces; with an empty one it gives general styling advice for the item.
- **When it has nothing:** An empty wardrobe (`{"items": []}`) is not an error. The tool returns general styling advice instead of `""` or an exception. It never returns an empty string.

### `create_fit_card`

- **What it does:** Writes a short social-media caption for the find, based on the item and the outfit idea.
- **Inputs:** `outfit` (str, the string returned by `suggest_outfit`); `new_item` (dict, the same listing dict).
- **Returns:** A string of two to four sentences that reads like a real post, mentions the item, its price and its platform once each, and is specific about the vibe. Wording varies from run to run.
- **When it has nothing:** If `outfit` is empty or only whitespace, it returns a descriptive message string saying there is no outfit to write a caption for. It does not raise and does not call the model.

## Planning Loop

<!-- Your branch rule, stated as a rule — the condition AND both paths — plus
     the file and function that holds it.

     Like this:
       "If search_listings returns an empty list, put a message in the session
        and stop. Otherwise take the first result and go to suggest_outfit."
        — agent.py::run_agent

     The grader checks your code against what you claim here, so the file and
     function have to be real. -->

**Branch rule:** If `search_listings` returns an empty list, put a message in `session["error"]` that names what the user could change (loosen the price ceiling, drop the size, or use fewer or different keywords), leave `session["fit_card"]` as `None`, and return the session without calling `suggest_outfit`. Otherwise, put the first result in `session["selected_item"]` and go on to `suggest_outfit`, then `create_fit_card`.

**Where it lives:** `agent.py::run_agent`

**How the query is parsed:** <!-- regex, string splitting, or asking the model — say which -->

**What moves through the session:** <!-- which fields, in what order -->

---

## Sample Run

<!-- Two things go here.

     1. One FULL query and its output, pasted as text.
     2. Your three per-tool terminal tests — the command and what it printed. -->

**One full query**

```
$ python app.py ask '...'

```

**The three tools, tested one at a time**

```
$ python -c "from tools import search_listings; print([(r['id'], r['title'], r['size'], r['price']) for r in search_listings('graphic tee', max_price=30)])"
[('lst_002', 'Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print', 'S/M', 18.0), ('lst_006', 'Graphic Tee — 2003 Tour Bootleg Style', 'L', 24.0), ('lst_017', 'Mesh Long-Sleeve Top — Black', 'S/M', 15.0), ('lst_033', 'Vintage Band Tee — Faded Grey', 'L', 19.0), ('lst_011', 'Low-Rise Cargo Pants — Khaki', 'W29', 27.0), ('lst_012', 'Oversized Crewneck Sweatshirt — Vintage Navy', 'XL (fits oversized)', 20.0), ('lst_015', 'Vintage Graphic Hoodie — Faded Black', 'L', 26.0)]
```

```
$ python -c "from tools import suggest_outfit; from utils.data_loader import get_example_wardrobe, load_listings; print(suggest_outfit(load_listings()[5], get_example_wardrobe()))"
**Outfit 1: 90s Grunge**
Pair the graphic tee with your **baggy straight-leg jeans, dark wash**. Layer your **vintage black denim jacket** on top. Anchor the look with your **black combat boots** and wear the **black crossbody bag**.

**Outfit 2: Streetwear Contrast**
Tuck the graphic tee into your **wide-leg khaki trousers**. Cinch the waist with the **brown leather belt**. Throw your **oversized grey crewneck sweatshirt** over your shoulders and finish with your **chunky white sneakers** and **black crossbody bag**.
```

```
$ python -c "from tools import create_fit_card; from utils.data_loader import load_listings; print(create_fit_card('jeans and white sneakers', load_listings()[5]))"
Found this 2003 tour bootleg style graphic tee on depop for $24 and I'm obsessed. Giving major effortless Y2K concert vibes. Just gonna throw it on with some beat-up jeans and white sneakers and call it a day.
```

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. What you asked, what came back, what you changed.

     "I used Claude to help me code" is not enough.

     "I gave Claude my search_listings spec. It returned None on no match
     instead of an empty list, so I changed it" is the level we want. -->

**Moment 1**

- *What I asked for:*
- *What came back:*
- *What I changed:*

**Moment 2**

- *What I asked for:*
- *What came back:*
- *What I changed:*

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 4 — THE TEST ═══════════════════════

     Don't fill these in during unit 3.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Five criteria, five tries each, in this exact format.

     Five, because your criteria are written out of five. Mark each try PASS
     or FAIL, count the passes, and read that count against your target — a
     row targeting 4 of 5 with three PASS cells is MISSED (3/5).

     `python run_eval.py --label before` runs everything and writes the table
     into results/. Paste it here and fill in the verdicts. -->

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Real output from one try**, pasted as text, naming the file and function
that produced it:

## Verdicts and Diagnoses

<!-- MET or MISSED per criterion against LAST UNIT's target, plus a sentence on
     how you decided.

     Then, for every miss: which of the four places it happened — a tool, the
     loop's branch, the session, or the model's output — AND the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis:  "The fit card was bad."
     A diagnosis:      "The fit card criterion missed on 2 of 5 items. Both had
                        an empty brand field. My prompt puts the brand in the
                        first sentence, so the card opened with a blank and read
                        like a fragment. The tool worked; the prompt assumed a
                        field that isn't always there."

     Look for a pattern. Three misses on the same tool is one problem, not
     three. -->

| # | Criterion | Target | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |

**Diagnoses**

## Loop Trace

<!-- One full run, printed step by step, with the MCP call visible in it.

     `python app.py ask '...' --trace` once you've added the trace.step()
     calls in Milestone 2.

     Worth pasting BOTH the happy path and the empty-search path. The empty
     one should be visibly shorter, because it stops. If your two traces are
     the same length, your branch isn't working — and this is the fastest way
     anyone will ever find that out. -->

**Happy path**

```

```

**Empty search**

```

```

**On the MCP move:** <!-- what changed in your code, and whether anything
behaved differently afterwards. If the rewire didn't work, say exactly where it
broke — the error text and the last thing that worked. That earns the point in
full. -->



---

## The Improvement

<!-- What you changed, why your diagnosis pointed at it, and the after-run in
     the same table format. One change, measured properly.

     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

**What I changed:**

**Which failure it was meant to fix:**

### Run Log — After

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- If it made things worse, say that. Honestly reported, that earns full
     credit and is more interesting than one that worked. -->



---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed: what you'd do, and why you stopped where
     you did. "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is
     left is not. -->
